# P1-Image-Classification-by-Machine-Learning-AICTE-Internship

I have done this project to classify images by using CNNmodel and Pre Trained Mobile Net model. I created the streamlit app for the same.
In this project, i explore various preprocessing techniques, including morphological transformations, and delve into data augmentation using data generators to enhance the diversity of our training dataset. We'll build and analyze different network architectures through ablation experiments, perform hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance, and implement a mechanism to store the best model on disk.

## Technologies Used

    Python
    Jupyter Notebook / IDE
    Key Libraries used:
        tensorflow - for data automation, model tracking, performance monitoring, and model retraining. 
        numpy - for numerical operations
        scikit-learn - for machine learning algorithms
        NLTK - for natural language processing(tokenization,stopwords,punctuations, etc.)


## Steps:

1 Data Ingestion

2 Data Transformation

3 Model Trainer

4 Model Evaluation

5 Model Deployement
